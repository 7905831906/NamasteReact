# package.json is the configuration of the npm.
# There are two types of dependencies-
 1. DEV type dependencies
 2. Normal type dependencies

# DEV Type Dependencies-
  * It is required in a developement phase.
  * When we are developing our app, then we required dev dependencies 

# Normal Dependencies- It is used in production also.

#Caret(^)-It is used to upgrade automtically with minor version.
#Tilde(~)-It is used to upgrade automatically with major version.

#Package.json- it keeps the track of what version of that package installed in your system.(approx version)
-If there is minor version comes, it upgarde the package with it.

#Package-lock.json-It keeps the track of exact version of that package.

#Transitive dependencies- those dependencies have their own dependencies in node modules.

//Parcel-npm install Parcel

# It is must to put package.json and package-lock.json in your repository
#If we have package.json and package-lock.json, we can recreate all our node_modules by using command-npm install
that's why we cannot put node_modules files on Github.
